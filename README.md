# LIRI
LIRI (_Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface) is a CLI Node.js app that searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies using an easy-to-use Inquirer interface.

# Install

Clone the repository to your machine. Download and install the dependencies.

`npm install`

Create a .env file to store your API keys for Spotify, OMDB, and Bands in Town. Format the file as such:

`SPOTIFY_ID=your id here`

`SPOTIFY_SECRET=your secret here`

`OMDB_ID=your key here`

`BANDSINTOWN_ID=your key here`

# Usage

Navigate to the repository. In the command line, start the application. 

`node liri.js`

Using the arrow as your cursor, select one of the options to begin searching Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, or OMDB for movies.

Type in a response to the prompt (see _How to Enter Commands_ for details on specifics) to get a response.

Based on your choice, you will receive some data about a song, movie, or band you're interested in. If run successfully, the output will be logged to the `log.txt` file (and create the file if it doesn't exist yet).
